This challenge is tasked with creating an advanced movie recommendation system to meet the increasing demand, preparing data to power this system. The objective is to help users discover movie reviews and similar films that match their preferences. To achieve this, I gathered data from two main sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database. By combining data from these sources, the recommendation system will offer users a wide array of movie reviews and related titles. Additionally, the text extracted from these APIs will be used for natural language processing (NLP) to better understand user preferences.

Here are the steps completed for this challenge:

Part 1: Access the New York Times API.
Part 2: Access The Movie Database API.
Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export.

I required the necessary code imports and access to API keys which were saved in a .env file to ensure my API keys correctly were set up for a smooth data retrieval from the APIs to generate the desired output for users.
